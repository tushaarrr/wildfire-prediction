# 🔥 FireSight – AI-Powered Wildfire Risk Prediction

**FireSight** is a full-stack AI-powered platform that predicts wildfire risk using real-time weather data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and geolocation (latitude & longitude). The system combines machine learning with weather APIs and interactive dashboards to visualize fire threats and provide actionable insights.

## 🛠 How to Run the Project

### 1. 🖥 Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind CSS)
```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

> App will run at: `http://localhost:3000`

---

### 2. ⚙️ Backend (FastAPI + ML model)

#### (a) Create & activate a virtual environment
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### (b) Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


```

#### (c) Run the FastAPI backend
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

> API will run at: `http://localhost:8001`
